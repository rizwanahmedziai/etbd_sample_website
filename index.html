    <h1>Zeki Experts Solutions</h1>
    <p>
        Zeki Expert Solutions is a leader in the movement to teach<em> technical sophistication</em>, the seemingly magical ability to take
        command of your computer and get it to do your bidding. This includes
        everything from command lines and coding to guessing keyboard shortcuts,
        Googling error messages, and knowing when to just reboot the darn thing.
        We believe there are <strong>at least a billion people</strong>  who can benefit from
        learning technical sophistication, probably more. To join our
        movement, <a href="https://www.zekiexperts.com">sign up for our official email list</a> now.

            <strong>HTML</strong> was created by the original "web developer", computer scientist
            <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tim_Berners-Lee">Tim
            Berners-Lee</a>. It's not true that Sir Tim invented HTML in order to
            share pictures of his cat, but it would be cool if it were.

        You may have seen him shredding guitar live with Capital Cities on Jimmy
        Kimmel, Conan, or The Ellen Show, but rest assured Nick is a true nerd
        at heart. He's just as happy shredding well-spec'd lines of code from a
        tour bus as he is from his kitchen table.
